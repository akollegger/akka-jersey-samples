        <h1>HTTPS Client/Server Example - Grizzly</h1>

        <p>This example demonstrates how to develop RESTful HTTPS Server using
            Grizzly and how implement HTTPS Client using Jersey with server authentication.</p>

        <h2>Contents</h2>
        <h3>Server side</h3>

        <p>This example consists of just one resource - RootResource, which is
            basically copy of HelloWorld Resource from corresponding sample with little
            improvement.</p>

        <p>Other classes are used to start Grizzly embedded server and set up its
            authentication and authorization mechanism and keystore and truststore.
        </p>

        <h3>Client side</h3>
        <p>Client side is implemented as a test case, see class <b>com.sun.jersey.samples.https_grizzly.MainTest</b>,
            and its method testSSLWithAuth (others are just tests for invalid authorization).
            First thing you have to do if you want to communicate with service via
            https is set up <b>SSLContext</b> which is basically providing keystore and
            truststore. Keystore is used for storing own keys and truststore is used for storing certificates to
            which you have decided to trust. For more informations see <a href="#JSSERefGuide">[1]</a>.</p>
        <p>To set <b>SSLContext</b> on Jersey client you have to create instance of <b>com.sun.jersey.client.urlconnection.HTTPSProperties</b>
            and set it as a property to the client instance:

        <pre>    HTTPSProperties prop = new HTTPSProperties(null, context);

    DefaultClientConfig dcc = new DefaultClientConfig();
    dcc.getProperties().put(HTTPSProperties.PROPERTY_HTTPS_PROPERTIES, prop);

    Client c = Client.create(dcc);</pre>


<h3>Certificates setup</h3>
<p><b>These steps are not required to run this example. Pregenerated keystore and
truststore files are already present.</b></p>
<p>We needed set up few things to get this example working:
<ul>
    <li>generate client and server keys</li>
    <li>generate client and server certificates</li>
    <li>import certificates to corresponding truststores</li>
</ul>
Client certificate is needed too because we're going to use server-side
certificate authentication as well (yes, after this HTTP Basic authentication
seems to be kind of redundant but there are some usecases where you might
want to use them both).

<p>
    Generate client key and store it into keystore:<br />
<pre>keytool -genkey -keystore ./keystore_client -alias clientKey -dname "CN=Client, OU=Jersey, O=Sun Microsystem, L=Prague, ST=Czech Republic, C=CZ"</pre>
Generate client certificate (this will generate self-signed certificate; if you have certification authority and want generate certificate request, use keytool -certreq):<br />
<pre>keytool -export -alias clientKey -rfc -keystore ./keystore_client > ./client.cert</pre>
Import client certificate to servers truststore:<br />
<pre>keytool -import -alias clientCert -file ./client.cert -keystore ./truststore_server</pre>

These steps are similar for server side:
<pre>keytool -genkey -keystore ./keystore_server -alias serverKey -dname "CN=localhost, OU=Jersey, O=Sun Microsystem, L=Prague, ST=Czech Republic, C=CZ"
keytool -export -alias serverKey -rfc -keystore ./keystore_server > ./server.cert
keytool -import -alias serverCert -file ./server.cert -keystore ./truststore_client</pre>


<h2>Running the Example</h2>
<p>Run the example as follows:</p>
<p> test
<blockquote><code>mvn test</code></blockquote></p>
<p> run 
<blockquote><code>mvn compile exec:java</code></blockquote></p>
<p>From a web browser, visit:<br />
    <b style="color: red">This won't work! *</b>
<blockquote><code><a href="https://localhost:4463/">https://localhost:4463/</a></code></blockquote>
<b style="color: red">[*]</b> Your web browser needs have and use generated
client keys. Or you have to disable server side client
authentication - remove line (or set NeedClientAuth to false) <b>((SSLSelectorThread) webServer.getSelectorThread()).setNeedClientAuth(true);</b>
in <i>Server.java</i>. Then ignore any security warning (self-signed certificates
    aren't trusted in general) and login with username "user" and password "password".
    Text "JERSEY HTTPS EXAMPLE" should appear.
    
    <p>Mozila Firefox and Internet Explorer don't allow users to
    display any content provided on behalf of any self-signed certificate so you have to use some other
    browser which allows this (for example Safari or Opera).</p>
