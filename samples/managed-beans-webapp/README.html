        <h1>ManagedBeansWebApp Sample</h1>

        <p>This sample demonstrates the Java EE 6 feature of managed beans.
            JAX-RS root resource classes are annotated with @ManagedBean, which means EE-related
            resources may be injected into instances of those classes.
        </p>

        <h2>Contents</h2>
        <p>The sample consists of two root resource classes that are managed beans and
            one stateless session bean. One root resource class is managed in the
            default JAX-RS life-cyle of per-request and the other is managed in the
            lifecycle of singleton (meaning on instance per web application).
            <br/>
            Two EE-related artifacts are injected into each root resource class instance.
            The first is a resource constant defined in the web.xml.
            The second is a stateless session EJB.</p>

        <h2>Running the Example</h2>

        <p style="color: red">This sample utilizes EE6 features of the GlassFish
            in Glassfish v3 build 68 and later versions. This sample will not work with Glassfish v3
            Prelude or Preview.</p>

        <p>If you are working with Jersey GlassFish update center module installed into your existing GlassFish
            instance,
            you will need to follow instructions at <a href="../../README.html">the module README file</a> in order to
            deploy the example.

        <p>Otherwise, you can run the example using embedded GlassFish as follows:</p>

        <p>Build and deploy the project by executing maven 2 from the project directory</p>
        <blockquote><code>mvn clean package embedded-glassfish:run</code>
        <p style="color: red">Note: You need at least JDK 1.6 to be able to start embedded Glassfish V3.</p></blockquote>
