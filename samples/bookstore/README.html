    <h1>Bookstore Example</h1>
    <p>This example demonstrates how to connect JSP pages to resources. The example is copied from
       the <a href="https://stapler.dev.java.net/getting-started.html">Bookstore</a> example presented
       by the <a href="https://stapler.dev.java.net/">Stapler</a> project that provides a way to staple
       URIs to Java classes to build RESTful Web applications such as <a href="http://hudson.dev.java.net/">Hudson</a>.
    </p>
    <p>A bookstore Web application is presented that is capable of presenting books, CDs and tracks of CDs.
     
    </p>

    <h2>Contents</h2>
    <p>The example consists of four web resources implemented by the following:
        </p><dl>
            <dt><code>com.sun.jersey.samples.bookstore.resources.Bookstore</code></dt>
            <dd>The bookstore resource that returns a list of items, either CDs or Books.
                The resource dynamically references a Book or CD resource using the
                getItem method that is annotated with Path.
                The Book and CD resource both inherit from the Item class and thus the
                resources can be managed ploymorphically.
            </dd>
            <dt><code>com.sun.jersey.samples.bookstore.resources.Book</code></dt>
            <dd>The book resource that has a title and an author.
            </dd>
            <dt><code>com.sun.jersey.samples.bookstore.resources.CD</code></dt>
            <dd>The CD resource that has a title, author and a list of tracks.
                The resource dynamically references the Track resource using the
                getTrack method that is annotated with Path.
            </dd>
            <dt><code>com.sun.jersey.samples.bookstore.resources.Track</code></dt>
            <dd>The Tracks resource that has a name and the length of the track.
            </dd>
        </dl>
    <p>The mapping of the URI path space is presented in the following table:</p>
	<table border="1">
	<tr>
	<th>URI path</th>
	<th>Resource class</th>
	<th>HTTP methods</th> 
    <th>JSP page</th>
    </tr>

	<tr>
	<td>/</td>
	<td>Bookstore</td>
	<td>GET</td>
	<td>/com/sun/jersey/samples/bookstore/resources/Bookstore/index.jsp</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>

	<tr>
	<td>/count</td>
	<td>Bookstore</td>
	<td>GET</td>
	<td>/com/sun/jersey/samples/bookstore/resources/Bookstore/count.jsp</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td>/time</td>
	<td>Bookstore</td>
	<td>GET</td>
	<td>/com/sun/jersey/samples/bookstore/resources/Bookstore/time.jsp</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td>/items/{itemid}</td>
	<td>Book, CD</td>
	<td>GET</td>
	<td>/com/sun/jersey/samples/bookstore/resources/Book/index.jsp,<br>
        /com/sun/jersey/samples/bookstore/resources/CD/index.jsp </td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td>/items/{itemid}/tracks/{num}</td>
	<td>Track</td>
	<td>GET</td>
	<td>/com/sun/jersey/samples/bookstore/resources/Track/index.jsp</td>
	</tr>

	</table>

    <h2>Running the Example</h2>

    
      <p>Bookstore example runs on Glassfish V3 Prelude application server (<a href="http://glassfish.dev.java.net/">http://glassfish.dev.java.net</a>), which can be run as an embedded container.

      <p>If you are working with Jersey GlassFish update center module installed into your existing GlassFish instance, 
you will need to follow instructions at <a href="../../README.html">the module README file</a> in order to deploy the example.
<p>Otherwise, you can run the example using embedded GlassFish as follows:</p>

      <p>Build and deploy the project by executing maven 2 from the project directory</p>
      <blockquote><code>mvn clean package embedded-glassfish:run</code>
      <p style="color: red">Note: You need at least JDK 1.6 to be able to start embedded Glassfish V3.</p></blockquote>
      
      <p>Goto the URL:<p>
      <blockquote><a href="http://localhost:8080/bookstore/">http://localhost:8080/bookstore/</a></blockquote>
      
      <p>Notice: if you see an error message in your browser, just go back to the command line, where you run <code>mvn clean package glassfish:run</code> from
      and hit <code>Enter</code> to redeploy the application. This is needed to workaround a bug in currently used embedded GlassFish version.
      After redeployment, you should be able to refresh the page in your browser window and see the Bookstore example index page.

    <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>This example shows how to support polymorphism of resources and JSP pages.
         Hence it is possible to add another resource, such as a DVD resource with associated JSP pages,
         which extends Item without having to change the logic of Bookstore or the existing JSP pages.</p>
         
      <p>JSP pages are associated with resource classes. Such JSP pages are resolved
         by converting the fully qualified class name of the resource class into a path
         and appending last path segment of the request URI path to that path.
         
         For example, when a GET is performed on the URI path "/" then the path
         to the JSP page is "/com/sun/jersey/samples/bookstore/resources/Bookstore/",
         and in this case since the last path segment is empty "index.jsp" is
         appended to the path. Then the request us forwarded to the JSP page
         at that path.
         
         Similarly when a GET is performed on the URI path "/count" then the
         path to the JSP page is "/com/sun/jersey/samples/bookstore/resources/Bookstore/count.jsp".
      </p>
      <p>The JSP variable "it" is set to the instance of Bookstore so that the index.jsp, or count.jsp,
         has access to the Bookstore instance as a Java bean.
      </p>
      <p>If a resource class inherits from another resource class then it will automatically 
         inherit the JSPs from the super class.</p>
      <p>A JSP page may also include JSPs using the inheritance mechanism,
         for example the index.jsp page associated with the Book resource class includes a
         footer.jsp page whoose location is specified by the super class, Item.
